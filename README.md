#h1 Mix and Match
#hr
The project i have decided to work on and make is a memory game, this game is a matching card game where you two card with the same animal on it. The game has three levels which are Easy,Medium and Hard, also the is a flip counter which count how many times you click each card the reason for this is to make the game more intresting.

#h1 UX
#hr
My main audiance target is anyone from any age group who is intrested to play a very peacful game that challenges their brain.
I have chosen to make the game very simple and easy to maneuver around so that the person who plays does mnot come across any difficulties.
The game has three levels Easy, Medium and Hard, there is no compition against time because i decided to let people take there time to complete the levels with any fuss or over stressing, this would also allow people to take multitask while they play the game e.g, if some on is completing a course work and wants to bounce from the game to there work often they have all the time in the world to do this without any stress.

As a user type i want to make my game as entertaing and calm as i can , my main focus is making sure people enjoy there time.
I also want to male it as interactive as posible so that the game player can feel connected.
Here is list of the most important user stories that has been brought up from the prespective of the specific that i aim for:
1.I want to open the game and find it easy to play without having to be confused and lost without reading the instructions.
2. i want to use every tool on the website and know it is working without any problems.
3.what type of genre/game do i want to play?
4.Dose this person have enough information on the website ?( you would be able to find my wireframe on the following link.....)
#h1 feature
when you first go on the game you would see a overlay text in big bold writing which says "start game" if you click on this it would lead you to the main meue where you are able to choose which level you want to play, this is also when the background music starts to play.

On another section of the game which is the home page wher you first land you would see three large buttons with links that says Easy, medium and hard if you click on the buttons it would directly take you to the exact level you have picked.
 
 #h3 Features left to be implemented 
 #hr
 In the future i would like to add a feature which shows a scoreboard it would also allow you to log your name in and it would save all the data to see which name has won. from this i would achive the fact that people can play against other, this would make the game very intresting and competative this is an amazing feature beacuse it would get people communicating whith each other while they are having fun playing a game. 
 #h1 Technologies used
 1. HTML this is where i put all the information that i want people to view when they see my website, i used four index pages index.html, easy.html, medium.html and hard.html
2. CSS this is where i style all my html so i can attract the viewes when looking at my website.
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1) i used bootstrap to get the layout that i am looking for.
4.javaScript to make the game interactive.
5.jquary this project uses jquary to simplyfy DOM manipulations.

#h1 Testing
#hr
I belive that i have achived to showcase my memory game in a way players who view my game would undersatnd and interact with in the most easiest way while they are enjoying themselves. On desktop mode the game allows you to play three challenging levels each level has a certain amout of cards depending on which level your playing (easy level has fewer cards opposed to the hard level) at. However if you view on a mobile device you would only be able to play one level the easy level, the reason is because the would be so much scrolling if all levels where on the mobile first approch this can get irratating or boring and my aim is to keep everyone happy and not find anything to complain about.  In the footer i put my social media, viewers would have to click on the social media icons this would lead them to another tab where my social media open up in. I put overlay text that pops up quite frequently so my viewers can feel like there is a level of communication and intraction while they play the game.

I can be contacted from the contact section.

I tested this website across a few browsers (chrome, firefox, safari and internet explore), i have also tested it on diffrent device and sizes eg;- iphone XR; Iphone 6, samsung 1 plus ipad and a macbook pro. The diffrent sizes i viewed it on are (ipad 768 x1024) iphone xr(375 x 814) and laptop (1280 x 800)

while i was doing the tests i relised if all three levels was on the mobile version it would get very annoying to play as there would be alot of scroling in the game so i decided to only view the easy level.
